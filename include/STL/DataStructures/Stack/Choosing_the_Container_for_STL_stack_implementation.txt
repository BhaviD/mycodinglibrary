Each of the underlying storage structures for a stack has different
performance criteria. Hence, a programmer should choose the container
most suited to the application. In general, a vector is the most
efficient for relatively small stacks. A vector loses efficiency when
it must frequently be resized to accommodate the size of the stack.
In this case, the deque container is a better choice; the deque
manages memory more efficiently than a vector. A list container is
specifically designed to allow for general insertion and deletion at
any position. Because a stack does not use this feature, there is
little reason for using a list to store the stack's elements.
