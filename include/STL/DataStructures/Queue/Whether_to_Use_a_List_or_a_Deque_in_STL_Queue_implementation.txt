The list-class implementation add each item to the list as an individual element.
As pop() operations erase elements, the list class reclaims the memory and efficiently
reuses it for subsequent insertions. By contrast, a deque allocates memory in blocks
and performs insert and erase operations in a fashion similar to a vector. Generally,
the deque implementation will be faster. However, the programmer should try the application
both ways and determine which implementation performs the best.
